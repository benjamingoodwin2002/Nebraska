I am currently based in Los Angeles with experience in developing, programming, packaging, and publishing games created with Unreal Engine. 
Over the years I have worked on and released several projects written mostly using Blueprint and this year my goal was to release a game written in C++. Nebraska Horror Game has just been published on Steam (Oct 2021); while it was a passion project and not intended as a commercial endeavor, I am proud that it received a positive rating and sold 400 copies in its first week without promotion. 
Until now I have been a one-man game developer which requires that I am proficient across a broad range of tools and competencies. I am resourceful and versatile, I have had to wear many different hats in order to produce a complete game. 
My competencies include: level design, programming, physics model interaction, enemy AI (incl behavior trees, blackboards, etc), inventory systems, vectors/linear algebra, Slate/UMG, sound engineering, etc.
While doing all aspects of game production and publishing has taught me a lot, I am looking to join a video game company so that I can focus on my core strengths and develop deep expertise in programming, which is the area I enjoy most. This would not preclude me from contributing in other areas too.

Nebraska Horror Game (February 2021 - October 2021)
https://www.nebraskahorrorgame.com/

Nebraska is a survival horror game I created on unreal engine 4 that is heavily inspired by games like Amnesia the dark descent and Penumbra black plague.  Nebraska was written in C++ and UE4 blueprint. The game has an advanced physics system where players operate in a fully interactive environment. 

The gameplay requires that players solve puzzles on each level in order to advance. Some of the puzzles require the use of objects to overcome obstacles within the advanced physics model. Like many games in this genre, Nebraska has a sophisticated inventory system. 
Added dimensionality is achieved by players managing their body temperature, as getting too cold or hot could result in hypothermia or heat stroke. 

The game also includes several enemies the player encounters. These enemies utilize patrol points until they hear sounds or see the player. The enemies have the ability to reposition themselves successfully and also determine the shortest path to their target. 

Nebraska has just been published on Steam and received a positive rating and sold 400 copies in its first week without promotion.

The main villain is an NPC that features Eli Harris as the voice actor.

Older Projects:

Penumbra Birth (Computer Science Tech Show Project) (December 2019 - June 2020)

Penumbra Birth was a project I created on Unreal Engine 4 for my Computer Science major at Benson polytechnic high school. Penumbra Birth was a fan-made prequel to the Penumbra series. Penumbra was created on the HPL 1 engine so all the models and sounds from the game had to be converted and remade to be imported to Unreal Engine 4 using tools such as Maya, Blender, Quixel Mixer, and Audacity. Some assets were changed on Quixel Mixer to have stronger normal maps and more detail to appear less outdated. 
Penumbra Birth unintentionally became the blueprint for Nebraska as all the gameplay mechanics for Penumbra were remade in Unreal Engine 4 such as physics, examinations, level doors, etc. Penumbra Birth was very much a rough draft of what Nebraska would become because everything was written in Blueprint, physics were less polished, and AI could only follow patrol points and chase the player. Penumbra Birth was never released to the public and just remains a school project since I did not own the rights to the models or Penumbra games.

Amnesia Modifications (April 2017 - July 2017)

Amnesia the Dark Descent is a survival horror game created by Frictional games that allows players to create their own games using their HPL engine. Creating games on the HPL engine is pretty similar to normal game design the only difference is you have to own Amnesia to play the application and the C++ is simplified with predefined variables and functions. This was a good way for me to start out when I was still learning Unreal Engine, programming, and game design as a whole. It also allowed me to release several projects and get consumer feedback (character development, level design, lighting, bugs, storyline, etc) to improve my project. 
After developing the Penumbra II & Penumbra Europa mods I wanted to explore modeling and animating because custom content was better received in the Amnesia community. I created and animated several enemy models using Zbrush to sculpt and texture, maya to rig and animate, and Quixel Mixer to add higher levels of detail to already textured models.
